The work has won the third prize at MICCAI Challenge (UWF4DR 2024) on Ultra-Widefield Fundus Imaging for Diabetic Retinopathy.

## Abstract

In this work, we propose Many-MobileNet, an efficient model fusion strategy for retinal disease classification using lightweight CNN architecture. Our method addresses key challenges such as overfitting and limited dataset variability by training multiple models with distinct data augmentation strategies and different model complexities. Through this fusion technique, we achieved robust generalization in data-scarce domains while balancing computational efficiency with feature extraction capabilities
