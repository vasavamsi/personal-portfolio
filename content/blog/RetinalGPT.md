## Abstract

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention for their remarkable ability to process and analyze non-textual data, such as images, videos, and audio. Notably, several adaptations of general-domain MLLMs to the medical field have been explored, including LLaVA-Med. However, these medical adaptations remain insufficiently advanced in understanding and interpreting retinal images. In contrast, medical experts emphasize the importance of quantitative analyses for disease detection and interpretation. This underscores a gap between general-domain and medical-domain MLLMs: while general-domain MLLMs excel in broad applications, they lack the specialized knowledge necessary for precise diagnostic and interpretative tasks in the medical field. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{RetinalGPT}, a multimodal conversational assistant for clinically preferred quantitative analysis of retinal images. Specifically, we achieve this by compiling a large retinal image dataset, developing a novel data pipeline, and employing customized visual instruction tuning to enhance both retinal analysis and enrich medical knowledge. In particular, RetinalGPT outperforms MLLM in the generic domain by a large margin in the diagnosis of retinal diseases in 8 benchmark retinal datasets.Beyond disease diagnosis, RetinalGPT features quantitative analyses and lesion localization, representing a pioneering step in leveraging LLMs for an interpretable and end-to-end clinical research framework.
