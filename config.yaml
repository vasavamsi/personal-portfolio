      Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vamsi, a machine learning maestro with a knack for turning data into insights. As a Graduate Student Researcher at <a href="https://acims.asu.edu/" style="color: orange;">ASIMS</a> Lab, ASU, I'm working on Thesis to push the boundaries of AI by teaching them to mimic the real world assembly line industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing. My Research work is supervised by <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/333046" style="color:orange;">Dr. Hessam Sarjoughian</a> and is supported by <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html" style="color: orange;">Intel Labs</a>.
      
      I got immense experience With a toolbox full of Python, AWS, and an array of ML libraries, I'm always ready to tackle the next exciting challenge in Computer Vision, Time Series analytics or Natural Language Processing. Whether it's leveraging GenAI to aid healthcare diagnostics or simulate the real world scenarios, I am all in!
      
      Let's connect and explore how we can leverage AI to make a real-world impact. Who knows? We might just train a model that changes the game! ðŸš€
